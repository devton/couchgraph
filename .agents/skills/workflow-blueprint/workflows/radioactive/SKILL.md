## agentic-workflows-blueprint.workflow.radioactive

### Goal

Provide a portable, end-to-end 11-phase development lifecycle workflow that enforces strict quality gates from initial problem discovery to final review, fix iteration, institutional memory update, and changelog generation.

---

### Scope

- **Applies to**: Non-trivial features, architectural refactors, or cross-layer implementations (e.g. backend + API + frontend) across any project or tech stack.
- **Does not cover**: Single-file trivial bug fixes, pure documentation edits (use `document`), or isolated test additions.

---

### Triggers

- "Run radioactive lifecycle"
- "/radioactive [feature description]"
- "Full-cycle feature development"
- "Implement feature with end-to-end quality gate"

---

### Inputs

- `featureDescription`: Short text describing the feature or task (optional; if missing, triggers Phase 2 discovery).
- `projectSlug`: Short identifier for the repo (e.g., `apix`, `my-backend`).
- `baseBranch`: Target integration branch (default: `main` or `develop`).
- `techStack`: Stack details (e.g., `Ruby on Rails + PostgreSQL`, `Next.js + TypeScript`).
- `existingRootDoc`: Main instruction file (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc.).
- `uiInvolved`: Boolean flag indicating if frontend/UI changes are required.
- `maxFixAttempts`: Maximum iterations for the Phase 9 fix loop (default: 3).

---

### Invariants (Guardrails)

1. **Sequential Phase Pipeline**: All 11 phases must execute in exact numerical order. No phase skipping.
2. **Abstract Entrypoint Fallback**:
   - **If a primary project skill exists** (e.g. `skills/<projectSlug>/SKILL.md` or `.agents/skills/<projectSlug>/SKILL.md` or `AGENTS.md`): Read it, classify request, and enforce project-specific hard rules and routing.
   - **If NO primary project skill exists**: Trigger `/workflow-blueprint` init (or `plan-to-blueprint`) to scaffold baseline project context and routing before proceeding.
3. **Socratic Discovery Gate**: Phase 2 must present discovery questions and wait for explicit user response/confirmation before Phase 3/4.
4. **Plan Approval Gate**: Phase 4 must generate a structured task breakdown at `docs/tasks/task.<reference>.md` and obtain explicit user approval before Phase 5.
5. **Executable Blueprint Contract**: Phase 5 must scaffold a reusable workflow contract at `skills/<projectSlug>/workflows/<feature-slug>/SKILL.md`.
6. **Pass/Fail Quality Gate**: Phase 7 specs must pass 100%. Phase 9 fix loop must resolve all 🔴 (Blockers) and 🟠 (High) findings before declaration of completion.
7. **Institutional Memory**: Phase 10 must capture newly discovered patterns into workflow contracts and update project documentation.
8. **Operational Safety for Infra Tasks**: When the feature affects network, infrastructure, IaC, or OS baselines, execution must include explicit rollback, change window alignment, and post-change health validation.

### Procedure

```
Phase 1  — CLASSIFY & INIT  → Project skill or /workflow-blueprint init
Phase 2  — DISCOVER         → /brainstorming (Socratic questions & decision log)
Phase 3  — UX DESIGN        → /ui-ux-pro-max or frontend-design (if UI involved)
Phase 4  — PLAN             → /plan-writing (structured task breakdown in docs/tasks/task.<reference>.md)
Phase 5  — BLUEPRINT        → /workflow-blueprint (scaffold feature contract)
Phase 6  — EXECUTE          → Implement tasks sequentially with evidence-based edits
Phase 7  — TESTS            → Project test runner (specs/tests for all changed code)
Phase 8  — REVIEW           → /thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review or /review
Phase 9  — FIX LOOP         → /thermo-fix × up to 3 (resolve 🔴→🟠→🟡, verify build, re-review)
Phase 10 — BLUEPRINTS       → /workflow-blueprint (update skills & internal contracts)
Phase 11 — CHANGELOG        → /changelog-generator or /changelog (user-facing release note)
```

#### Phase 1 — CLASSIFY & INIT

1. Check for the existence of the primary project entry skill (`skills/<projectSlug>/SKILL.md`, `.agents/skills/<projectSlug>/SKILL.md`, or `AGENTS.md`).
2. **Branch logic**:
   - **Option A (Project skill exists)**: Load the skill, classify the task using the project's routing matrix, and extract hard constraints and domain boundaries.
   - **Option B (Project skill does NOT exist)**: Initialize `/workflow-blueprint` (run scaffolding / `plan-to-blueprint` flow) to analyze the project structure, detect `projectSlug` and `techStack`, and establish a baseline entry skill.
3. Output a 1-paragraph context summary and the governing workflow contract.

#### Phase 2 — DISCOVER with /brainstorming

1. Load `brainstorming` skill (or run Socratic discovery protocol).
2. Ask 3–5 strategic questions covering scope boundaries, data models, security surface, integration points, and edge cases.
3. **Wait for user response.** Do NOT proceed to Phase 3/4 until questions are answered or user explicitly approves.
4. Summarize into a **decision log** appended to conversation context.

#### Phase 3 — UX DESIGN (Conditional)

1. **Check condition**: Run only if `uiInvolved` is true (or feature touches views, templates, or visual components).
2. Load UI design skill (`ui-ux-pro-max` or `frontend-design`).
3. Generate design tokens (color palette, CSS variables, typography) and responsive layout rules (using mobile-first `min-*` breakpoints).
4. Append UX design rules to the decision log.

#### Phase 4 — PLAN with /plan-writing

1. Load `plan-writing` skill (or task planning methodology).
2. Produce a structured task specification at `docs/tasks/task.<reference>.md` containing context, tasks with file targets, explicit dependencies, and verification criteria.
3. Present plan to user and **gate on explicit approval**.

#### Phase 5 — BLUEPRINT with /workflow-blueprint

1. Load `workflow-blueprint` (or `plan-to-blueprint`).
2. Transform the approved plan into an executable workflow contract saved at `skills/<projectSlug>/workflows/<feature-slug>/SKILL.md`.
3. Wire the new feature workflow into the project's routing matrix.

#### Phase 6 — EXECUTE

1. Execute tasks in `docs/tasks/task.<reference>.md` sequentially.
2. Read files before editing; apply minimal, targeted edits.
3. Track progress by marking `[/]` (in progress) and `[x]` (completed) in `docs/tasks/task.<reference>.md`.
4. For infra-impacting tasks, execute pre-change checks and capture rollback checkpoints before mutating state.

#### Phase 7 — TESTS

1. Run the project's test runner (e.g. `rspec-rails`, `vitest`, `pytest`, or `testing-patterns`).
2. Write unit/integration/system tests for all newly created or modified logic.
3. Iterate until 100% of specs pass.
4. For operational tasks, run infrastructure checks (connectivity, policy checks, service health, drift validation) and archive outputs.

#### Phase 8 — REVIEW with Code Quality Engine

1. Run code review (`thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` or `review` skill) against all files modified in the session.
2. Output a severity-ranked findings table:
   - 🔴 **Blocker**: Must fix before release.
   - 🟠 **High**: Fix in current cycle.
   - 🟡 **Medium**: Fix if trivial or record.
   - 🟢 **Low**: Informational.
3. Append findings table to `walkthrough.md` artifact.

#### Phase 9 — FIX LOOP (up to `maxFixAttempts` ×)

1. Iterate up to `maxFixAttempts` times:
   - Apply fixes for 🔴 Blocker and 🟠 High findings.
   - Run build verification command (`bun run build`, `rails runner`, `npm run test`, etc.).
   - Re-review modified files.
   - Stop loop early if zero 🔴 / 🟠 findings remain (verdict: APPROVED).
2. Update `docs/tasks/task.<reference>.md` and `walkthrough.md` with final verdict.
3. Create a clean git commit on the local working branch.

#### Phase 10 — BLUEPRINTS Update

1. Review discoveries made during execution.
2. Update existing project skills with new patterns, constraints, or schema details.
3. Scaffold new internal workflow blueprints if repeatable operations were introduced.
4. Update root doc (`AGENTS.md`) if core system rules changed.

#### Phase 11 — CHANGELOG Generation

1. Load `changelog-generator` (or `changelog` skill).
2. Analyze session git commits against base branch.
3. Generate customer-facing release notes categorized by Features, Fixes, and Improvements.
4. Append changelog entry to `walkthrough.md`.
