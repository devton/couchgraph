### Goal

Turn a technical plan into a tracked Linear project (milestones, parent
issues, sub-issues, status updates) using the `user-Linear` MCP server.

### Scope

- Applies to: multi-step initiatives that need tracking.
- Does not cover: writing the technical plan itself.

### Triggers

- Work spans multiple PRs or milestones.
- You need acceptance criteria and progress visibility.

### Inputs

- Linear team/project IDs (discover via MCP when unknown).
- `changeWindow` (optional): planned window for operationally sensitive updates.
- `riskClass` (optional): `low`, `medium`, `high`, or project-defined equivalent.
- `rollbackTicket` (optional): incident/change ticket reference for rollback path.

### Invariants

- If MCP tools fail due to auth, run `mcp_auth` for `user-Linear`.
- Always validate tool schema before calling MCP tools.
- Prefer 3-5 milestones and a small number of parent issues per milestone.
- If `riskClass` is `high`, require explicit operator confirmation before write operations.

### Procedure

1. List projects and teams, then choose the correct team/project context.
2. Capture operational metadata when provided (`changeWindow`, `riskClass`, `rollbackTicket`).
3. Create milestones.
4. Create one parent issue for the initiative.
5. Create child issues by milestone and optional actionable sub-issues.
6. Add operational metadata in issue/project descriptions when relevant.
7. Publish periodic project updates with: completed, in-progress, next.

### Outputs

- Linear project structure with milestones and linked issues that mirrors the
implementation plan.

### Review gate

- Team/project context is explicit.
- Milestones and issues are linked consistently.
- Update cadence and status visibility are defined.
- Operational metadata is preserved when provided.
